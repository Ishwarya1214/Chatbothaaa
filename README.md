## 🌟 **Project Description**
The **Hospital Appointment Management System (HAMS)** is a cutting-edge solution designed to automate and simplify the hospital appointment scheduling process. By integrating a chatbot interface with robust backend systems built on **Python**, **MySQL**, and **Streamlit**, this system prioritizes patient satisfaction and hospital efficiency.  

HAMS allows patients to:  
1. **Register and Log In Securely**: User credentials are protected using **password hashing** with the `hashlib` library.  
2. **Book Appointments**: Patients can book appointments based on their symptoms and real-time doctor availability, ensuring they are matched with the right specialists.  
3. **Get Immediate Confirmations**: The system provides instant confirmation for appointments, reducing patient anxiety.  

Additionally, **hospital staff** benefit from streamlined administrative functionalities, such as managing doctor schedules and adding new personnel, making HAMS a holistic solution for modern healthcare.
